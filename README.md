# âœ¨FAQ

**Q: Why bother with Vulkan?** A: Vulkan is a newer, lowâ€‘overhead graphics API. One UIÂ 7 BetaÂ 1 defaulted to Vulkan, which kept temperatures cool and battery life strong. BetaÂ 2 reverted to OpenGLâ€”enter overheating and drain. This script forces Vulkan back on.

**Q: Is it safe?** A: Absolutely! It leverages official ADB commands â€” no system hacks, no risk.

**Q: Must I run it after every reboot?** A: Yes, but check out [this Reddit tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23Ultra/comments/1kdsmks/comment/mqdq7o3/?context=3) for a PCâ€‘free, oneâ€‘andâ€‘done method.

**Q: Why does it close all apps?** A: Apps must relaunch under Vulkan. Some may insist on a reboot â€” just rerun the script if needed.

**Q: Do I need a USB connection?** A: Nope. Plug in before or after launching â€” the script will either not see a device, and therefore prompt you to go back to the main menu, where you can select the requested procedure again, or it WILL se a device, in which case it will go right away and do the procedure you requested.

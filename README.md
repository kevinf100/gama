# âœ¨FAQ

**Q: Why bother with Vulkan?** A: Vulkan is a newer, lowâ€‘overhead graphics API. One UIÂ 7 BetaÂ 1 defaulted to Vulkan, which kept temperatures cool and battery life strong. BetaÂ 2 reverted to OpenGLâ€”enter overheating and drain. This script forces Vulkan back on.

**Q: Is it safe?** A: Absolutely! It leverages official ADB commandsâ€”no system hacks, no risk.

**Q: Must I run it after every reboot?** A: Yes, but check out this Reddit tutorial for a PCâ€‘free, oneâ€‘andâ€‘done method.

**Q: Why does it close all apps?** A: Apps must relaunch under Vulkan. Some may insist on a rebootâ€”just rerun the script if needed.

**Q: Do I need a USB connection?** A: Nope. Plug in before or after launchingâ€”the script will detect your device when you hit Enter.

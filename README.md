âœ… What It Does
This .bat script forces your Samsung Galaxy S23, S23+, or S23 Ultra to use Vulkan instead of OpenGL for GPU rendering â€” no root required. Ideal for those who have updated to OneUI 7.
This will provide you with better performance and better battery life.

ðŸ§© Requirements
â€¢ A computer that runs Windows.
â€¢ SDK Platform Tools. [Download](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip).
â€¢ The script itself. [Download](https://github.com/popovicialinc/s23_oneui7_vulkan/releases/download/v1.0.0/Force.Vulkan.S23.S23+.S23.Ultra.-.OneUI.7.bat).

ðŸ“¦ Installation & Usage
Okay, now that you have gathered all the essential, we have to set it all up.

SETTING UP ADB.EXE (if you haven't already)
1) Extract "platform-tools-latest-windows.zip" to a safe, permanent location â€” somewhere you wonâ€™t accidentally delete or move it later.
2) Within the just-extracted folder, search for "adb.exe", right-click it and select "Copy as path". This will be useful in just a moment.
3) Search for "Edit the system environment variables"
4) In the bottom-right corner, you should see "Environment Variables...'; click on it.
5) Now, you're faced with two section: "User variables" (on the top) and "System variables" (on the bottom).
6) In "System variables", you should see a table with the headers "Variable" and "Value". On the first column (whose header is "Variable"), locate "Path" and double-click on it.
7) Now, pick any blank spot (where there isn't ANY text whatsoever; make sure NOT to mess with anything that's already there, you could break something!), double-click on that blank spot, and paste the path of "adb.exe" (see step 2 if you haven't copied its path already)
8) To test if you have done the steps correctly, search for CMD (Command Prompt), and type "adb". If a bunch of text appears, you're golden; if not, re-do the previous steps)
9) If you have succesfully followed each steps and confirmed everything is working fine, you are good to go!
10) Keep pressing "OK" until all panels are closed.

FORCING VULKAN RENDERING
You've done great in setting up ADB, excellent job!
1) Locate the "Force.Vulkan.S23.S23+.S23.Ultra.-.OneUI.7.bat" script (should be in your Downloads), and double-click on it.
